# bddschedule

This program is to search a scheduling path from the initial state to a given final marking of a P-timed Petri net of FMSs by using BDD techniques. 
Before running it, create a file of incidence matrix (netname_matrix.txt) and a file containing initial marking, processing time and final marking (netname_init.txt) in the same folder as the source file (BDDScheduling.cxx).

Use: Buddy-2.2 software

The details of the method can be found in the paper: Bo Huang, et. al., Symbolically Scheduling of FMS on Timed Petri Nets, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, Submitted.
